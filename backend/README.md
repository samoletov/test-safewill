# Safewill test

Create a top 10 website for something you're passionate about. Movies, books, songs, be as creative as
you'd like.

## The project should consist of two parts:

1. API that hosts the content
2. Front end used to display the data
   - The user should be able to click through each top 10 item to see more details about it
   - Each item should include at minimum a title, description and an asset such as an image or video
   - The top 10 listing page should have a search input that allows the user to search for a specific result
   - The API should connect to a database and have a way to seed data and contain at least one migration
   - The API should have two endpoints:
3. /list - to view the top 10 items
4. /item/$id - to view details about a specific item
